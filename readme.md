## Predicting music using corpus data

The goal of this notebook is to generate melodies which vary in predictability.
This is both in terms of content and also in terms of timing.
The most useful notebook will be `IntervalPrediction.ipynb`

To run it you will need the following python packages:
  - music21
    - http://web.mit.edu/music21/
  - matplotlib
  - numpy

As well as jupyter notebook... for potentially obvious reasons.

To see sheet music embedded in jupyter notebook you will also need a MusicXML reader such as [MuseScore](https://musescore.org).
If you have trouble getting it to work, look to the music21 [tutorial]
